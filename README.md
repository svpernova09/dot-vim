# Usage
The [https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen](pathogen) plugin will be needed first.  Follow it's installation instructions before proceeding with this repository.

Start by cloning the repository and all of it's submodules down to the local system correctly.  Make sure to use the `--recursive`` option.  Git submodules are in use, and to avoid extra work you can have all the submodules download their respective projects in one fluid motion.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/dan9186/Vimderp.git ~/.vim
```

Copy the `vimrc` file from `~/.vim/vimrc` to `~/.vimrc`
